# Auckland PT Tracker

An android app delivering a rich bus experience using Auckland Transport APIs.

Contributors welcome.

## Description for Google Play

Track buses, trains and even ferries through Auckland in real time.

Choose between picking a stop/station from the map or viewing all vehicles live. Select your service and watch it approach as you time your movements. Easily flick on the traffic layer to see if your bus is going to be held up. Mark stops and routes as favourites for easy access later and quickly change between your recent stops from the side menu.

Auckland PT Tracker is designed as the tool for ‘power users’ of Auckland’s transport system. It draws from two independent sources of information so you can always be the best informed at the bus stop, even when one source is down (it wouldn’t be Auckland Transport if nothing went wrong!). 

Information is made as transparent as possible – all network requests are indicated by a spinning circle and failures are made clear to the user. You can always see exactly how long ago the bus or train reported their location which takes the guesswork out of knowing when to trust.

The tracker has been designed to limit mobile data usage by only requesting the route you are interested in and stopping tracking once your stop has been reached. Google maps and native android controls are used to give a smooth and familiar user experience.

Auckland PT Tracker is an open source project created by a daily user of Auckland’s public transport system. Feature requests are welcome so you have the chance to shape the app without any software development knowledge or time commitment.

Note: All features are available for bus services and almost all features for train services. Ferry locations are shown in the live map but boat names are not matched to routes. This is due to a limitation of the Auckland Transport provided interfaces.
